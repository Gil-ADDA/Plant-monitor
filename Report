plant monitor for rasing awernce for nature / making the growt of plant tangible and accuret 

the best analogy that i found for this project is the human body abilitiys 

sensor of the DHT-22 is our senses 
Raspberyy Pi is our brain 

what is the MQTT server 
what is the API and the data visualisation ? 

first im excited about the idea tham im connecting things to the internet to a real server 

first time that i learn the bilities of the shell platfom and sudo command that even help me with the web arcitecture course

what about photosynthesis 
first i connect the

what about arduino pocess 
what you did with the arduino app to make all work 

what type of code you use 

#General facts that have to put under the right title
connecting the data to time series in arduino on the sensor 
and install time on the RAS-PI

SD CARD install the RA-PI software on it for then use the shell. to configure the RA-PI to Plugin with INfluxDB Telegraf and grafana 
MQTT share the data with CASA STAFF 

Data that suprise me is the mouister data that have up and down and affected by the amount of people that in the LAB and 
that effect as well on the temperature inside the class 

we dont really need to use grafan to display the data cause INFLUXDB doing that as well but what i have learnd that grafan can make lot of query and it is very powerfull tool to display few component of data

using API KEY - TOKEN 

generally the plant monitor shoudld run for 9 months in thouse condition in class but i would recommned to check the nails ones a months and to check the condition of the nails. 


Humidity vs moisture_ 
Moisture is the the amount of water in the soil 
Humidity is the amount of water in the air 



The arcitecture 



Future work 
connect camera ? 
and show the progress in more visual way
add the ability to count the amount of light
